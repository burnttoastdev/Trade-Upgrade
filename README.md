# Trade Upgrade

**Tired of the villager trade limit holding back your progress? Trade Upgrade offers a solution!** This data pack introduces a new late-game item that significantly increases the maximum trade limit of villagers, eliminating the tedious process of endlessly shuffling villagers. This project was my first full data pack, born out of the frustration of managing villager trades and a desire for a more streamlined experience.

## Key Features

* Craft a Trade Upgrade using emerald blocks and a netherite upgrade smithing template.
* Use the Trade Upgrade on a villager to dramatically increase their max trade cap:
    * Novice trade cap -> 40
    * Apprentice trade cap -> 30
* Includes recipes for Villager and Wandering Trader spawn eggs, providing a more convenient way to obtain villagers without relying on lengthy transportation.
* Features helpful in-game error messages to prevent accidental upgrades on ineligible villagers (e.g., baby villagers or nitwits).

## How to Install

1.  Go to the [releases](link-to-releases-here) and choose which version you want (typically the latest).
2.  Decide if you want to download the pack as a pure data pack or packaged as a mod.
3.  Click the corresponding link on the chosen release.
4.  Download the chosen data pack (.zip file) or mod (.jar file) from Modrinth.
5.  **For data packs:** Place the downloaded .zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world. **Remember to enable the data pack in your world settings.**
6.  **For mods:** Place the downloaded .jar file into your `.minecraft/mods` folder.

## How to use the Trade Upgrade

Once you have a Trade Upgrade in hand, right-clicking within 5 blocks of an eligible villager will apply the upgrade to the one closest to you. Upgraded villagers will have their novice and apprentice trade maximums significantly increased.

> Note: Novice villagers, baby villagers, and nitwits cannot be upgraded.
